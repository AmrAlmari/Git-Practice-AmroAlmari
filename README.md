# Git & GitHub Assignment

## Part 1: Theoretical Questions

### 1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

**Git** is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during development.  
**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories, collaborate with others, and use features like Pull Requests, Issues, and Actions.

### 2. Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.

- `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but doesnâ€™t merge them into your local branch.
- `git pull` does both: it fetches and then automatically merges the changes into your current local branch.

### 3. What is the purpose of `.gitignore` file?

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore. Common use cases include ignoring temporary files, logs, and compiled code like `__pycache__/` or `.env`.

### 4. Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub.

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push the branch to your GitHub fork.
6. Open a Pull Request to the original repo.
7. Discuss and improve your changes as needed, then get them merged.
